# RGP_3
A successor to RGP_2 using Unity and made into an android app
My first time using Unity and i liked it so much that this project is still a work in progress. Many more updates to made with This becominga a pitstop simulator where the time for pitstops are'nt random but depends on how quick you can execute.
The game will still have a random element to it but this will entail other cars.
Things to be added:
  -Menu and game modes
  -Safety car
  -Animation for a safety car
  -Tyre degredation to be implemented with speed reducing with laps completed - might be exponentially
  -Two cars will be playable whilst two cars will be computer - random pit stops and pit stop times included
  -Saftey car to be used of tyre degradation gets too bad since car will sttop moving
  -Weather may  be added in the future
